Abstract
========

This PEP outlines Python's backwards compatibility policy.

Rationale
=========

As one of the most used programming languages today \[\#tiobe\]\_, the
Python core language and its standard library play a critical role in
millions of applications and libraries. This is fantastic. However, it
means the development team must be very careful not to break this
existing 3rd party code with new releases.

This PEP takes the perspective that "backwards incompatibility" means
preexisting code ceases to comparatively function after a change. It is
acknowledged that this is not a concrete definition, but the expectation
is people in general understand what is meant by "backwards
incompatibility", and if they are unsure they may ask the Python
development team and/or steering council for guidance.

Backwards Compatibility Rules
=============================

This policy applies to all public APIs. These include:

-   Syntax and behavior of these constructs as defined by the reference
    manual.

-   The C-API.

-   Function, class, module, attribute, and method names and types.

-   Given a set of arguments, the return value, side effects, and raised
    exceptions of a function. This does not preclude changes from
    reasonable bug fixes.

-   The position and expected types of arguments and returned values.

-   Behavior of classes with regards to subclasses: the conditions under
    which overridden methods are called.

-   Documented exceptions and the semantics which lead to their raising.

-   Exceptions commonly raised in EAFP scenarios.

Others are explicitly not part of the public API. They can change or be
removed at any time in any way. These include:

-   Function, class, module, attribute, method, and C-API names and
    types that are prefixed by \"\_\" (except special names).

-   Anything documented publicly as being private.

-   Imported modules (unless explicitly documented as part of the public
    API; e.g.Â importing the `bacon` module in the `spam` does not
    automatically mean `spam.bacon` is part of the public API unless it
    is documented as such).

-   Inheritance patterns of internal classes.

-   Test suites. (Anything in the `Lib/test` directory or test
    subdirectories of packages.)

-   Backward compatibility rules do not apply to any module or API that
    is explicitly documented as **Provisional** per PEP 411.

Basic policy for backwards compatibility
----------------------------------------

-   In general, incompatibilities should have a large benefit to
    breakage ratio, and the incompatibility should be easy to resolve in
    affected code. For example, adding an stdlib module with the same
    name as a third party package is generally not acceptable. Adding a
    method or attribute that conflicts with 3rd party code through
    inheritance, however, is likely reasonable.

-   Unless it is going through the deprecation process below, the
    behavior of an API *must* not change in an incompatible fashion
    between any two consecutive releases. Python's yearly release
    process (:pep:`602`) means that the deprecation period must last at
    least two years.

-   Similarly a feature cannot be removed without notice between any two
    consecutive releases.

-   The steering council may grant exceptions to this policy. In
    particular, they may shorten the required deprecation period for a
    feature. Exceptions are only granted for extreme situations such as
    dangerously broken or insecure features or features no one could
    reasonably be depending on (e.g., support for completely obsolete
    platforms).

Making Incompatible Changes
===========================

Making an incompatible change is a gradual process performed over
several releases:

1.  Discuss the change. Depending on the degree of incompatibility, this
    could be on the bug tracker, python-dev, python-list, or the
    appropriate SIG. A PEP or similar document may be written. Hopefully
    users of the affected API will pipe up to comment.

2.  Add a warning. If behavior is changing, the API may gain a new
    function or method to perform the new behavior; old usage should
    raise the warning. If an API is being removed, simply warn whenever
    it is entered. `DeprecationWarning` is the usual warning category to
    use, but `PendingDeprecationWarning` may be used in special cases
    where the old and new versions of the API will coexist for many
    releases \[\#warnings\]\_. Compiler warnings are also acceptable.
    The warning message should include the release the incompatibility
    is expected to become the default and a link to an issue that users
    can post feedback to.

3.  Wait for the warning to appear in at least two major Python
    versions. It's fine to wait more than two releases.

4.  See if there's any feedback. Users not involved in the original
    discussions may comment now after seeing the warning. Perhaps
    reconsider.

5.  The behavior change or feature removal may now be made default or
    permanent having reached the declared version. Remove the old
    version and warning.
